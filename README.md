Final assignment for Digital Circuit Course at AGH UST

The task was to implement digital counter modulo 16 with up/down switch on [Altera UP2 Education Kit](http://circuitslab.case.edu/manuals/Altera_UP2_Education_Kit_Manual.pdf) in both VHDL and SystemVerilog.

These implementations count ticks of global clock divided to 2Hz frequency.
